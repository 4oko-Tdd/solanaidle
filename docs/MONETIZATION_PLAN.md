# Seeker Node — SKR Utility & Monetization Model

SKR token:
- Network: Solana
- Mint: `SKRbvo6Gf7GondiT3BbTfuRDPqLWei4j2Qy2NPGZhW3`
- Position in UI: top Resource Bar (shown with core resources)

## Philosophy

- SKR is NOT required to play.
- SKR enhances agency, not power.
- SKR creates ecosystem alignment with Solana Mobile.
- SKR introduces soft pressure without pay-to-win mechanics.
- Core gameplay loop remains intact without spending.

---

# 1. Core Free Model

Every Epoch:
- 1 free Boss Entry
- 3 Lives
- Standard contribution scaling
- Equal drop eligibility based on contribution %

No SKR required to play or win.

---

# 2. SKR Utility Layer (Controlled & Capped)

## 2.1 Reconnect Protocol (Main SKR Sink)

### Mechanic

During the World Boss:
- Player has a % chance to become "Node Destabilized"
- This temporarily removes them from contributing damage
- Player auto-recovers for free after a short timeout
- Player can pay SKR for instant recovery

Player may activate:

### Reconnect Protocol
Cost: 25 SKR
Limit: 1 per epoch

Effect:
- Instant recovery from destabilized state
- Restore passive damage contribution immediately
- No additional bonus multiplier

Purpose:
- Agency recovery, not power boost
- Emotional save moment
- Creates SKR sink without whale abuse

Hard Cap:
- Maximum 1 paid reconnect per epoch

---

## 2.2 Overload Amplifier (Strategic Option)

Optional SKR usage before triggering OVERLOAD:

Cost: 18 SKR
Limit: 1 per epoch

Effect:
- +10% to final OVERLOAD burst
- Does NOT stack
- Does NOT multiply contribution beyond defined cap

Purpose:
- Tactical decision
- Resource + SKR tradeoff
- Minor edge, not dominance

---

## 2.3 Raid License (Optional Upgrade)

Free Entry:
- Normal contribution scaling

Premium Raid License (per epoch):
Cost: 35 SKR

Grants:
- +5% contribution efficiency

Does NOT:
- Increase drop odds directly
- Increase roll count
- Stack across purchases

Limit: 1 per epoch

Purpose:
- Soft subscription model
- Status signaling
- SKR alignment without economy distortion

---

# 3. SKR Distribution Model

Every SKR spent is automatically distributed:

- 50% Burn
- 30% Seeker Treasury
- 20% Seasonal Reward Reserve

No pooled gambling system.
No direct redistribution of player funds.

---

# 4. Drop System Integrity

Boss Drops remain based on:
- Contribution %
- RNG (server-side / VRF-based when applicable)

SKR purchases do NOT:
- Add extra roll attempts
- Add extra drop slots
- Guarantee rare loot
- Multiply drop chances

Fairness remains intact.

---

# 5. Anti-Whale Safeguards

- All SKR mechanics capped per epoch
- No stacking purchases
- No unlimited reentries
- Contribution scaling capped
- No purchasable extra lives

---

# 6. Future Expansion (Phase 2)

- Cosmetic-only NFT skins purchasable in SKR
- Guild banner NFTs
- Seasonal boss themes purchasable via SKR
- Inventory expansion via SKR (soft utility, not power)

---

# 7. Current Implementation Status

Implemented now:
- Reconnect Protocol (25 SKR, once per epoch)
- Overload Amplifier (18 SKR, +10% OVERLOAD, once per epoch)
- Raid License (35 SKR, +5% passive contribution efficiency, once per epoch)
- Destabilization system with free auto-recovery window
- SKR spend routing:
  - 50% burn
  - 30% treasury
  - 20% reserve
- SKR shown in mobile Resource Bar

---

# 8. Economic Intent

Goal:
- Create steady SKR burn pressure
- Encourage Solana Mobile token circulation
- Avoid Ponzi / P2E mechanics
- Preserve gameplay integrity
- Maintain mobile-first accessibility

---

# Summary

SKR is:
- An agency enhancer
- A tactical layer
- A social signaling layer
- A burn pressure mechanism

SKR is NOT:
- Required to win
- Required to compete
- A gambling mechanic
- A pay-to-win multiplier

Seeker Node remains a game first.
SKR becomes its strategic meta-layer.
